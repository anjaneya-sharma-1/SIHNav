This aims to improve data accuracy in the Bharat Pashudhan App, addressing the issue of breed misclassification by field workers. The solution should integrate with the app and provide breed suggestions.",
    "description": "Background\n\nThe Government of India is implementing the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA) for systematic data recording of breeding, health, and nutrition of dairy animals. Field Level Workers (FLWs) are responsible for capturing animal data on the ground. However, despite multiple training programs, a recurring issue is the incorrect identification and registration of animal breeds of cattle and buffaloes. This misclassification significantly affects the integrity and usability of the data for research, policy planning, and targeted interventions.\n\nDescription\n\nBreed identification errors in BPA often arise due to manual judgment and lack of breed-specific awareness among FLWs. India, being home to a diverse array of indigenous and crossbred cattle and buffalo breeds, presents a complex challenge for accurate breed identification. Incorrect entries compromise the value of collected data and, in turn, impact the effectiveness of genetic improvement, nutrition planning, disease control, and overall program outcomes.\n\nTo address this, an AI-driven solution that can identify the breed of an animal using its image can prove extremely valuable. By using image recognition and machine learning techniques, the software can standardize breed identification and minimize manual errors. If successfully developed and validated, such a system can be integrated with the BPA to act as a decision-support tool for FLWs during registration.\n\nExpected Solution\n\n• Uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image analysis to recognize and classify the breed of cattle and buffaloes based on images.\n\n• Can handle diverse environmental backgrounds, lighting conditions, and varying animal poses.\n\n• Maintains a breed database (for the most common Indian cattle and buffalo breeds and their crosses).\n\n• Provides breed suggestions or confirmations at the time of registration in BPA.\n\n• Can be seamlessly integrated with the BPA platform to support real-time validation or correction of breed entries.\n\n• Includes a user-friendly interface for FLWs with minimal technical training requirements.",

The goal is to develop an AI-driven system that extracts body structure parameters from images and generates standardized scores, integrating with the existing Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA). This solution aims to enhance data quality and support the Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) by the Government of India.",
    "description": "Background: In dairy farming, evaluating the body structure of animals is vital to predict their longevity, productivity, and reproductive efficiency. Traditionally, Animal Type Classification (ATC)—which involves scoring animals for physical traits—is conducted by trained personnel through visual inspection and manual measurement of specific body parts. However, this manual method is prone to human error and subjectivity, even with trained professionals, resulting in inconsistent and potentially unreliable data.\n\nWith advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image processing technologies, there is an opportunity to automate this process. Automated scoring based on images can ensure standardization, minimize observer bias, and improve the reliability of data captured for scientific and breeding purposes.\n\nDescription: The Government of India is implementing the Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) since December 2014, aiming to conserve and develop indigenous bovine breeds, genetically upgrade the bovine population, and enhance milk productivity. Under this mission, Progeny Testing (PT) and Pedigree Selection (PS) programs are being carried out in key dairy breeds across the country to produce high genetic merit bulls for breeding purposes.\n\nAnimal Type Classification (ATC) is a crucial step in identifying top-performing elite dams, which are potential mothers of future breeding bulls. Currently, ATC is performed manually by a trained Animal Typer who visually examines and measures physical traits, and then records the scores in the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA). Despite training, errors due to fatigue, bias, or measurement inaccuracies can adversely affect data quality and scientific analysis.\n\nThere is a need for an AI-driven solution that can automate this classification process by analyzing animal images, extracting body structure parameters, and assigning standardized scores with minimal human intervention. If integrated with BPA, such a solution would enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scientific validity of animal evaluation under PT and PS programs.\n\nExpected Solution: Students are expected to develop an AI-based Auto Recording of Animal Type Classification System that can:\n\nUse images of cattle and buffaloes to evaluate physical traits relevant to Animal Type Classification.\n\nExtract and quantify specific body structure parameters (e.g., body length, height at withers, chest width, rump angle, etc.) using AI and image processing techniques.\n\nGenerate objective and consistent classification scores.\n\nAuto-record and store the classification data in a structured format.\n\nProvide seamless integration with BPA to auto-save the classification records at the time of evaluation.\n\nBe user-friendly and operable by field personnel with minimal technical skills.",

    "summary": "The problem focuses on optimizing train traffic control in Indian Railways to maximize section throughput and minimize travel time. It involves developing an AI-powered decision-support system to assist controllers in making real-time decisions for train precedence and crossings, considering various constraints and priorities.",
    "description": "Background\n\nIndian Railways manages train movements primarily through the experience of train traffic controllers. While effective, this manual approach faces limitations as network congestion and operational complexity grow. Trains of varying types and priorities must share limited track infrastructure across space and time, making optimal allocation a significant challenge. The problem is a large-scale combinatorial optimization task with numerous constraints such as safety, track resources, system of working, signalling system, platform availability, train schedules, and train priorities. As real-time decisions become increasingly complex, there is a growing need for intelligent, data-driven systems powered by optimization algorithms and AI to enhance efficiency, punctuality, and utilization of railway infrastructure.\n\nDetailed Description\n\nCurrently, experienced traffic controllers oversee operations and take real-time decisions—whether a train should proceed, halt, or be rerouted—based on operational conditions and institutional knowledge. With rising traffic volumes and higher expectations for punctuality, safety, and efficiency, manual decision-making alone is becoming insufficient.\n\nThe network is constrained by finite infrastructure—limited track sections, junctions, crossings, and platform capacities—shared by long-distance express, suburban local, freight, maintenance blocks, and unscheduled specials. Coordinating these movements across spatial (network layout) and temporal (scheduling) dimensions while maintaining safety and minimizing delays is formidable.\n\nWithin a section managed by a section controller, the core problem is to decide train precedence and crossings to maximize throughput and minimize overall train travel time, considering section characteristics (e.g., line capacity, gradients, signal placements) and varying train priorities. This represents a dynamic, large-scale combinatorial optimization problem with an exponentially large solution space, further complicated by real-time disruptions (breakdowns, weather, rolling stock delays). Human intuition alone is no longer sufficient; intelligent decision-support tools are required to improve precision, scalability, and responsiveness.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nAn intelligent decision-support system that assists section controllers in making optimized, real-time decisions for train precedence and crossings. The system should:\n\n• Leverage operations research and AI to model constraints, train priorities, and operational rules, producing conflict-free, feasible schedules dynamically.\n\n• Maximize section throughput and minimize overall train travel time, with the ability to re-optimize rapidly under disruptions (e.g., incidents, delays, weather).\n\n• Support what-if simulation and scenario analysis to evaluate alternative routings, holding strategies, and platform allocations.\n\n• Provide a user-friendly interface for controllers with clear recommendations, explanations, and override capabilities.\n\n• Integrate with existing railway control systems and data sources (signalling, TMS, timetables, rolling stock status) via secure APIs.\n\n• Include audit trails, performance dashboards, and KPIs (punctuality, average delay, throughput, utilization) for continuous improvement.",

    "description": "Background\n\nIn Ayurveda and other traditional medicine systems, Rasa (taste) is a fundamental criterion for identifying, classifying, and determining the therapeutic value of medicinal herbs. While this taste-based assessment has been effective for centuries, it is inherently subjective, relying on human perception and expert experience, which often leads to variability and inconsistency.\n\nIn the modern context, ensuring the authenticity, quality, and standardization of herbal raw materials is a critical challenge due to widespread adulteration, batch-to-batch phytochemical variations, and the global demand for reliable herbal products.\n\nRecent advances in sensor science and analytical technologies provide innovative solutions to these challenges. Electronic tongue (e-tongue) systems can mimic human gustatory mechanisms by detecting complex chemical signatures, while spectroscopic techniques such as Near-Infrared (NIR), Raman, and UV-Visible spectroscopy offer rapid, non-destructive chemical profiling of herbal samples.\n\nWhen integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)—such as chemometric modelling, neural networks, and pattern recognition—large datasets can be analyzed to classify herbs based on taste profiles, threshold levels, and phytochemical composition with high precision.

The system aims to improve transparency, build consumer trust, and support ethical sourcing practices.",
    "description": "Background\n\nThe Ayurvedic herbal supply chain in India is characterised by fragmented networks of smallholder farmers, wild collectors and multiple intermediaries, leading to challenges in ensuring consistent quality, authenticity and sustainable sourcing of medicinal plants. Variations in harvesting practices, environmental conditions and manual record-keeping introduce risks of mislabeling, adulteration and over-harvesting of vulnerable species, undermining consumer trust and compliance with regulatory standards. Geographic provenance is often undocumented or opaque, making it difficult for manufacturers and regulators to verify that herbs originate from approved regions or follow sustainable collection guidelines.\n\nA blockchain-based traceability system, augmented with geo-tagging technology, can address these gaps by creating an immutable, decentralised ledger that records every step of the herb's journey—from on-site GPS-tagged collection events through processing, testing and formulation. Smart contracts on a permissioned network (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) can enforce sustainability criteria and automate quality validations, while IoT-enabled devices capture real-time location and environmental data at remote collection points, even via SMS-over-blockchain gateways where connectivity is sparse. By integrating FHIR-style metadata bundles (e.g., \"CollectionEvent,\" \"QualityTest,\" \"ProcessingStep\") and QR-code scanning at aggregation nodes, stakeholders gain end-to-end visibility, enabling rapid verification of provenance, streamlined certification for export and robust audit trails to support both biodiversity conservation and supply-chain efficiency. When herbs are formulated into finished products, unique, serialised QR codes generated by the blockchain platform could be affixed to each package. End customers scan these codes with a mobile app or web portal—powered by the same blockchain ledger—to retrieve a FHIR-style provenance bundle detailing each upstream event: farm of origin, harvest conditions, intermediary custody, laboratory certificates and batch formulation parameters. This consumer-facing transparency not only verifies authenticity and builds trust, but also supports ethical marketing, enables rapid recall management and fosters incentives for sustainable collection practices by linking premium pricing to verified harvest data. Over time, analytics on consumer scans can feed back into demand forecasting, closing the loop between consumer assurance and supply-chain optimisation.\n\nDescription\n\nA permissioned blockchain network will immutably record every stage of an Ayurvedic herb's journey—from geo-tagged harvest events by farmers or wild collectors, through multi-stage processing and laboratory testing, to the finished product on retail shelves. At the point of collection, GPS-enabled mobile or IoT devices capture precise location, timestamp, collector identity, species identification and initial quality metrics as a \"Collection Event.\" Subsequent \"Processing Step\" and \"Quality Test\" events—each embedding standardised metadata bundles—are added by processing facilities and testing laboratories. Smart contracts enforce National Medicinal Plants Board sustainability guidelines and Good Agricultural and Collection Practices by automatically validating geo-fencing rules, seasonal restrictions and quality thresholds before committing each transaction to the ledger.\n\nWhen formulation is complete, unique QR codes generated on-chain are affixed to product packaging. End customers scan these codes via a lightweight web or mobile portal (no specialised app required) to retrieve the full provenance record: farm coordinates and harvest conditions; chain-of-custody handoffs; lab certificates for moisture, pesticide and DNA-barcode tests; and sustainability and fair-trade compliance proofs. This consumer-facing transparency assures authenticity and safety, enables rapid recall notifications for affected batches and tells the story of each product—complete with interactive maps and farmer or community profiles. By combining tamper-proof audit trails, geo-tagged traceability and automated compliance enforcement, the system delivers a replicable model for ethical, sustainable and trust-driven Ayurvedic herb sourcing.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nParticipants will deliver a proof-of-concept blockchain-based botanical traceability system addressing end-to-end provenance of Ayurvedic herbs.

The platform should use technologies like OCR, AI, and blockchain to cross-verify documents against institutional databases, ensuring security and scalability.",
    "description": "Background\n\nWith increasing digitization, the problem of fake degrees and forged academic certificates has become a major concern for higher education institutions, employers, and government bodies. Cases of fraudulent documents being used for jobs, admissions, or government schemes have highlighted the absence of a robust mechanism to verify the authenticity of educational credentials issued by colleges and universities.\n\nAt present, verification is often manual, relying on physical inspection, emails to institutions, or outdated databases. This creates delays, inconsistency, and susceptibility to corruption or manipulation. To preserve academic integrity and public trust, there is a pressing need for an efficient, secure, and scalable digital system to detect and prevent the use of fake degrees.\n\nDetailed Description\n\nThe challenge is to create a digital platform that can authenticate and detect fake degrees or certificates issued by higher education institutions across Jharkhand. The system should be able to cross-verify uploaded documents (PDFs, scans, etc.) with institutional databases or credential registries, using metadata, QR codes, signatures, or embedded hashes.\n\nSuch a platform must work with both legacy certificates (issued before digitization) and new ones generated under university ERP systems. It should detect anomalies such as:\n\n- Tampered grades or photos\n\n- Forged seals or signatures\n\n- Invalid certificate numbers\n\n- Non-existent institutions or courses\n\n- Duplicate or cloned documents\n\nIncorporating AI, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and blockchain or cryptographic validation, the platform should enable seamless certificate verification by employers, admission offices, scholarship agencies, and government departments. The goal is to create a trustable and publicly accessible system that protects institutions’ reputation and safeguards student achievements.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nA smart, scalable, and secure Fake Degree/Certificate Recognition system that includes:\n\n• Upload interface for verifying entities (employers, institutions, agencies) to upload or input certificate details\n\n• Certificate authenticity checker that:\n\n   – Uses OCR to extract key details (name, roll number, marks, certificate ID)\n\n   – Matches it against a verified database (centralized or decentralized)\n\n   – Flags mismatches or formatting inconsistencies\n\n• Digital watermark or blockchain verification support for newly issued certificates\n\n• Institution integration module for universities/colleges to upload their certificate records in bulk or in real-time\n\n• Admin dashboard for authorized bodies (e.g., Higher Education Department) to monitor verification activity, detect forgery trends, and blacklist offenders\n\n• Alert system for invalid or forged entries\n\n• Data privacy and access control measures to ensure secure handling of student information\n\nThis solution must be adaptable across different institutions, work with both physical and digital certificates, and be affordable for state-wide rollout.",

These particles originate from the degradation of larger plastics or from microbeads in consumer products. Their persistence and bioaccumulative nature pose serious risks to aquatic life, ecosystems, and potentially human health. Current methods for detecting microplastics — such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy — are often accurate but time-consuming, expensive, and laboratory-dependent, limiting their application for real-time, field-based monitoring.\n\nDescription\n\nThe project aims to develop a low-cost, efficient, and portable sensor capable of detecting microplastics in various water sources. The focus may be on using optical detection techniques — such as light scattering, fluorescence, or absorbance — combined with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition. The sensor may be designed to identify microplastic particles based on their optical signatures, size distribution, and possibly polymer type. Water samples shall pass through a detection chamber, where embedded sensors capture spectral or visual data. This information would be processed in real time, either on-device or via a connected application. The system should be tested using standard microplastic samples (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene) and validated against existing lab-based techniques.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nThe expected outcome is a compact, field-deployable sensor system that can detect and quantify microplastics in water samples within minutes. It should offer reasonable sensitivity (down to 10–100 μm), operate on battery or solar power, and require minimal sample preparation. Additionally, the solution may include a companion software interface for data logging, visualization, and analysis. This innovation should have strong potential for adoption in microplastic monitoring, supporting researchers, environmental agencies, and water quality managers in making faster, data-driven decisions for pollution control and mitigation.",

    "description": "Background\n\nGrain size is a fundamental property used to classify beach types and plays a critical role in influencing coastal morphodynamic processes. However, measuring grain size is particularly challenging, as it requires scientists to visit each site to collect sediment samples. These samples must then undergo time-consuming physical processing in the laboratory to determine their characteristics. Moreover, because beach sediments are dynamic and constantly changing due to wave action, tides, and weather events, this process must be repeated regularly to maintain accurate and up-to-date data.\n\nDescription\n\nThe above problem statement envisages that a low-cost camera-based automated mapping system be developed to estimate the sediment grain size distribution of the sandy beach area (i.e., berm, intertidal, and dune) and classify the beach category of the measurement region. A low-cost camera-based mapping system, along with automated prediction algorithms, is used to estimate the sediment grain size distribution of a particular area of interest to be developed. Also, this system should incorporate a GNSS/GPS receiver to map the geographic positions of the measurement location.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nA low-cost camera-based mapping system with a GNSS/GPS receiver should be developed with an automated image processing algorithm for beach sand grain size estimation/classification.

    "description": "Background\n\nOceanographic data is vast, complex, and heterogeneous – ranging from satellite observations to in-situ measurements like CTD casts, Argo floats, and BGC sensors. The Argo program, which deploys autonomous profiling floats across the world’s oceans, generates an extensive dataset in NetCDF format containing temperature, salinity, and other essential ocean variables. Accessing, querying, and visualizing this data requires domain knowledge, technical skills, and familiarity with complex formats and tools.

    "description": "About CMLRE\n\nCMLRE, Kochi, an attached office under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, plays a key role in organising and promoting ocean development activities in India, with a focus on mapping, assessing, and managing marine living resources in the Indian EEZ. The Marine Living Resources Programme supports ecosystem-based research and monitoring, aimed at sustainable utilisation of these resources through scientific surveys, environmental studies, and data-driven ecosystem modelling.\n\nBackground\n\nIndia, with its vast coastline and rich marine biodiversity, relies heavily on the health of its ocean ecosystems for food security, climate regulation, and economic development. The Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE), under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, plays a pivotal role in collecting, managing, and analysing a broad spectrum of marine data to support sustainable ocean resource management.\n\nDetailed description\n\nCMLRE's datasets are diverse, complex, and multidisciplinary, including physical, chemical, and biological oceanography; fish abundance, species diversity, life history traits, and ecomorphology; fish taxonomy and otolith morphology; molecular biology data, including environmental DNA (eDNA) for species detection and biodiversity assessments. These datasets exist across various formats (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured), and are stored in siloed systems, making cross-domain integration, real-time visualization, and advanced analytics nearly impossible. This creates a major bottleneck for marine scientists, conservationists, and policymakers who need to make data-driven decisions for ecosystem conservation and fisheries management.\n\nCMLRE seeks an AI-enabled, intelligent digital platform that can integrate heterogeneous and high-volume datasets from oceanography, taxonomy, morphology, and molecular biology into a single unified system. The platform should support automated data ingestion, standardisation, and metadata tagging using internationally accepted formats, enable cross-disciplinary correlation analysis to study how ocean parameters influence biodiversity, fish distribution, and ecosystem health, and incorporate interactive modules for otolith shape and morphometrics visualisation, taxonomic classification and species identification, and molecular and eDNA data storage/retrieval and species matching.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThis platform will serve as a national marine data backbone, empowering India's scientific community with a next-generation tool for holistic marine ecosystem assessment. It will improve the efficiency of marine biodiversity research, enhance real-time decision-making, and support blue economy initiatives by enabling sustainable fisheries and conservation planning through integrated data insights.\n\nExpected Deliverables\n\n• A robust, cloud-ready web platform prototype.\n\n• Scalable backend architecture with modular data ingestion pipelines.\n\n• Visualisation tools for oceanographic and biodiversity trends.\n\n• Integrated modules for managing taxonomy, otolith morphology, and eDNA data.\n\n• Well-documented APIs and user manuals for future adoption and scaling.",

The current methods rely on databases that lack comprehensive sequences for deep-sea organisms, leading to misclassifications and underestimation of biodiversity. The proposed solution will minimize reliance on reference databases and reduce computational time.",
    "description": "Background\n\nThe deep ocean, encompassing vast and remote ecosystems like abyssal plains, hydrothermal vents, and seamounts, harbors a significant portion of global biodiversity, much of which remains undiscovered due to its inaccessibility. Understanding deep-sea biodiversity is critical for elucidating ecological interactions (e.g., food webs, nutrient cycling), informing conservation strategies for vulnerable marine habitats, and identifying novel eukaryotic species with potential biotechnological or ecological significance.\n\nEnvironmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive tool for studying these ecosystems by capturing genetic traces of organisms from environmental samples, such as seawater or sediment, without the need for physical collection or disturbance of fragile habitats. By targeting marker genes like 18S rRNA or COI, eDNA enables the detection of diverse eukaryotic taxa, including protists, cnidarians, and rare metazoans, offering insights into species richness and community structure.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE) will undertake routine voyages to the deep sea and collect sediment and water samples from hotspot regions for biodiversity assessment and ecosystem monitoring. The water and sediment samples will be used to extract eDNA and will be subject to high-throughput sequencing.\n\nHowever, assigning raw eDNA sequencing reads to eukaryotic taxa or inferring their ecological roles presents significant challenges, primarily due to the poor representation of deep-sea organisms in reference databases like SILVA, PR2, or NCBI. These databases, built primarily from well-studied terrestrial or shallow-water species, lack comprehensive sequences for deep-sea eukaryotes, leading to misclassifications, unassigned reads, or underestimation of biodiversity.\n\nTraditional bioinformatic pipelines for eDNA analysis, such as those implemented in QIIME2, DADA2, or mothur, rely heavily on sequence alignment or mapping to these databases, which is inadequate for novel or divergent deep-sea taxa. This dependency limits the discovery of new species and hinders accurate biodiversity assessments, critical for conservation in rapidly changing deep-sea environments. The computational time required for processing eDNA data exacerbates these challenges, particularly given the limitations of database-dependent methods and the complexity of eDNA datasets.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nTo address the challenges of poor database representation and computational time in deep-sea eDNA analysis, we propose an AI-driven pipeline that uses deep learning and unsupervised learning to identify eukaryotic taxa and assess biodiversity directly from raw eDNA reads. The solution should be able to classify the sequences, annotate and estimate abundance. This solution minimizes reliance on reference databases, reduces computational time through optimized workflows, and enables the discovery of novel taxa and ecological insights in deep-sea ecosystems.",

The goal is to develop cost-effective storage solutions that manage temperature and humidity, potentially incorporating technological advancements.",
    "description": "Background\n\nThe majority of the farmers in India store the onion in naturally ventilated storage structures. In such structures, onions are exposed to extreme temperatures and relative humidity, which reduces the shelf life of onions and high storage loss. Improved onion storage technology will help in ensuring the availability of onions between seasons and obviate seasonal volatility in prices. The solutions could be in the form of improved, but cost-effective, materials and design of storage structures to manage temperature and relative humidity.\n\nDescription\n\nOnion is a semi-perishable vegetable and is harvested during the rabi season, accounting for 65% of onion production, and hits the markets from April to May. The same crop must continue to meet the consumer demand till the month of October-November every year, before the kharif crop is harvested and brought to the market. It is therefore vital to store onions successfully in order to meet the regular supply. It is observed that nearly 30-40% of the crop is lost during storage due to various reasons in form of physiological weight loss, rotting, sprouting etc. In unexpected situations such as natural calamities, the losses even go beyond 50% creating heavy stress both on the demand and supply sides. The losses that occurred during storage are in terms of qualitative as well as in quantitative ways. Hence, it is imperative to take some crucial steps pertaining to onion storage with minimum losses to ensure an adequate supply to the market, thereby reducing the price fluctuations.\n\nVarious abiotic factors like temperature, relative humidity affect the health of onions; hence, their balance is essential to store the crop with minimum losses. Recent technological advancements (such as Design, Solar/Plasma/Irradiation energy, Nanotechnology, IoT including AI/ML) also offer an opportunity to provide infrastructure for onion storage and supply chain, besides value addition, even in rural India. Design innovations are pervading various sectors, including efficient onion storage at the farm level, rural as well as urban markets. Different process and product development advances will fetch better returns to farmers and competitive prices for consumers. More importantly, it will help in addressing the present as well as the impending challenges.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nExtension of shelf life with minimum loss.",

    "description": "Background\n\nThe safety of electrical installations hinges on reliable Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCBs). IEC 60898-1:2015 mandates rigorous short-circuit breaking capacity tests, crucial for ensuring MCBs perform correctly under severe fault conditions.\n\nExisting Problem\n\nCurrent manual or semi-automated testing methods for MCBs introduce significant challenges. These include imprecise R (resistive) and XL (inductive) circuit configurations, increased test times, and elevated safety risks for personnel during high-energy fault current generation (up to 10,000A). This impacts test accuracy, repeatability, and overall safety in the MCB certification process.\n\nDetailed Description\n\nThis proposal outlines an automated machine to precisely control test currents, voltages, and circuit impedance, executing high-current short-circuit tests on single pole, SPN, DP, TP, and FP MCBs (0.5A-63A) per IEC 60898-1:2015.

    "summary": "The project aims to develop an automated machine for preparing cable specimens for testing according to Indian standards. This machine will replace manual processes, reducing errors and improving the consistency of test results for cable safety and quality.",
    "description": "Background\n\nAccurate and consistent preparation of cable specimens is vital for reliable testing according to Indian Standards like IS 10810 (Parts 2, 7, 33) and IS 7098 (Parts 1 & 2). These tests, including conductor resistance, insulation/sheath thickness, and flame retardance, are crucial for ensuring cable safety and quality.\n\nExisting Problem\n\nCurrently, cable sample preparation involves significant manual intervention. The cable sample is manually cut by the operator and then straightened manually. Subsequently, these straightened PVC/XLPE/HDPE cable samples are cut into slices using electrically/pneumatically operated machines. Further, the samples are shaped as dumbbells by a dumbbell cutting machine. These manual and semi-automated steps are time-consuming, prone to human error, and introduce inconsistencies that compromise the accuracy and repeatability of critical test results.\n\nDetailed Description\n\nThis project develops an automated machine designed to precisely cut insulation and outer sheaths from cables, preparing specimens that strictly adhere to the aforementioned IS standards. Key features include an Automated Cable Feeding and Clamping System utilizing motor-driven rollers and adjustable clamps for secure, straightened cable handling. The Cutting and Stripping Module employs precision blades with programmable depths for clean, circumferential cuts and linear stripping, fulfilling specific length requirements for various tests. An integrated diameter sensor will auto-adjust settings. A Control System (PLC/HMI) manages operations, allows test method selection, monitors status, and provides closed-loop feedback. Automated specimen ejection and waste management further streamline workflow. Robust safety features like enclosed areas and interlocks will protect operators.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nThe automated machine will eliminate human error, guaranteeing consistent and repeatable specimen quality while significantly reducing preparation time and costs. By ensuring strict adherence to IS standards, the solution will yield more reliable test results and simplify product certification. This advancement will markedly improve accuracy, efficiency, and safety in cable testing, supporting high-quality control in the cable manufacturing industry.",

    "summary": "The problem focuses on finding a non-destructive method to test the purity of gold jewelry, replacing the current destructive fire assay method. The goal is to develop a method that is accurate, handles heterogeneous compositions, eliminates harmful emissions, and is suitable for regulatory and commercial use.",
    "description": "Background:\n\nHallmarking is the accurate determination and official recording of the proportionate content of precious metal in the jewellery/artefacts or bullion/coins. The hallmarking of gold jewellery was started in year 2000 and has been made mandatory since 23 June 2021 and presently covers 361 districts.\n\nThe Indian Standard, IS 1417 2016 \"Gold and gold alloys, jewellery/artefacts-fineness and marking specification\" covers hallmarking of six grades of gold jewellery/gold artefacts viz. 14K, 18K, 20K, 22K, 23K and 24K carats. The Indian Standard, IS 1418: 2009 \"Determination of gold in gold bullion, gold alloys and gold jewellery/artefacts - Cupellation (Fire Assay) method\" prescribes the fire assay test method for determining the fineness of gold in gold bullion, alloys, and jewellery/artefacts.\n\nThe fire assay testing method, though globally accepted and accurate, involves a destructive testing process wherein a sample of 250-500 mg is taken from the item by scrapping, drilling, or cutting. The method may lead to the damage of the article, rendering it unsellable, especially when dealing with a few or single article. However, the gold loss incurred during testing is almost negligible. Additionally, the process emits hazardous substances like lead oxides and nitrous fumes.\n\nFurther, BIS has also formulated an Indian Standard on method of test using ED-XRF (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence), i.e., IS 18458: 2023 \"Jewellery and precious metals ED-XRF test - Method of test\". This Indian Standard prescribes a non-destructive testing method to verify the fineness of the gold jewellery. However, the use of ED-XRF as a non-destructive method to determine the fineness is only applicable to homogenous gold jewellery. In addition, IS 18458: 2023 also has a provision for determination of fineness of jewellery by destructive testing, which is more suited for non-homogeneous jewellery.\n\nThere is another Indian Standard developed by BIS, IS 16901: 2022 \"Jewellery and precious metals determination of high purity gold, platinum and palladium - difference method using ICP-OES\". This method uses ICP-OES and is applicable only for high purity gold (999 ppt and above). ICP-OES is also a destructive testing method.\n\nIndia's gold jewellery industry is highly diverse, encompassing various types such as casted jewellery, handmade pieces with soldered joints, hollow and filled jewellery, gold-plated items, and studded ornaments using various jewellery manufacturing techniques. While casted jewellery is relatively homogeneous, the majority-particularly handmade and hollow varieties-are structurally complex and heterogeneous. This variability presents significant challenges in testing and hallmarking.\n\nIn the existing fire assay testing method, heterogeneity is addressed by melting the sample before testing. This eliminates impurities and ensures homogeneity. Moreover, fire assay being a difference method (based on initial and final weight of gold sample), the impact of heterogeneity is nullified. However, owing to its destructive nature, there is strong demand for an alternative non-destructive testing method.\n\nExpected Solution:\n\na. Develop and implement a non-destructive assaying method that matches the accuracy of fire assay without damaging the jewellery, while being capable of handling heterogeneous compositions (solders, fillers, non-metallic substances).\n\nb. Eliminate emissions of harmful substances (lead oxide, nitrous fumes).\n\nc. Achieve repeatability close to that of fire assay, ideally within ±0.5 ppt (as per IS 1418).\n\nd. Method selected will be validated for regulatory and commercial applications.\n\nDeliverables:\n\na. Detailed non-destructive innovative testing method with technical explanation\n\nb. References/bibliography related to the technical paper\n\nc. Scientific principles underlying the approach\n\nd. Feasibility studies and expected challenges\n\ne. Methodology for validation including accuracy assessment\n\nf. Explanatory note on potential for regulatory and commercial application",

    "title": "Real life solutions for Waste Management.",
    "summary": "India faces a significant waste management challenge, with a large portion of waste untreated and posing environmental risks. The problem proposes solutions like mandatory citizen training, waste worker training, community participation, and digital monitoring systems to improve waste management.",
    "description": "Background\n\nIn FY 2021–22, India generated approximately 1.7 lakh tonnes of municipal solid waste daily, of which only 54% was scientifically treated. Around 24% was dumped in landfills and 22% remained unaccounted due to leakages in the waste management chain. This unaccounted waste is often burned or disposed of in open areas, drains, or water bodies, posing severe environmental and public health risks. (CEEW, 2025) This calls for strict solutions to enable all the waste generators to contribute to Waste Management.\n\nDescription\n\nOverview: According to the CPCB’s Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Annual Report for 2021-22, India generates approximately 1,70,339 tonnes of waste per day (TPD). Of this, around 1,56,449 TPD is collected. Out of the collected waste, 91,511 TPD is treated, while 41,455 TPD is disposed of in landfills. This leaves a significant gap of 37,373 TPD in effective waste management.\n\nWaste treatment: The total waste processed/treated across the country is 91,511 TPD. When compared to the total waste generated, which is 1,70,339 TPD, it is found that an average of 54% of the waste is treated/processed across the country.\n\nSolid Waste Processing Facilities: A total of 249 Waste-to-Energy plants, 819 Biomass Power plants and 50.8 lakhs small Biogas plants have been set up in the country to generate Power/Biogas/BioCNG.\n\nExpected Solutions\n\nThe proposals aim to develop a strict system to ensure that every citizen is trained on waste management, waste workers get strict training and required safety gear, waste management facilities are present in every ULB/GP, and a dedicated decentralised monitoring system is in place. The solutions are as follows:\n\n1. Mandatory training for every citizen: Similar to countries where military training is mandatory for every citizen, in India, there shall be mandatory Waste Management training for every Waste Generator/Citizen. This will ensure source segregation, which will result in better waste management, lesser load on waste management facilities and landfills.\n\n  i. Physical training on types of waste, source segregation, how to make compost at home, re-use of plastic, etc.\n\n  ii. Distribution of 3 types of dustbins for dry, wet and domestic hazardous waste to every household/citizen.\n\n  iii. Distribution of a designed and tested compost making kit to every household/citizen.\n\n  iv. App-based monitoring.\n\n2. Phase-wise training to all Waste Workers\n\n3. Formation of Area Committee for Monitoring – to be called as “Green Champions”: Decentralised approach for Monitoring has to be done at every step of Waste Management for bulk waste generators, residential areas, commercial & Public semi-public building, Industrial buildings, etc.\n\n  i. Training of all Waste Generators\n\n  ii. Waste Generation: Source segregation happening or not, no wet waste to be collected\n\n  iii. Waste Collection happening on ground level\n\n  iv. Waste transportation\n\n  v. Waste treatment\n\n  vi. Waste Disposal\n\n4. Incentive based approach: Incentive to Bulk waste generators and other buildings for source segregation.\n\n5. Waste Movements in ULBs: Taking example from Karnataka’s Yadgir city, “If you see waste, send photo” similar movement to be made mandatory for every ULB regardless of its size and population, to ensure community participation.\n\n6. Community Participation: One day of all working staff regardless of employment type to be engaged in Cleaning of Public areas, waste management. Inspired from Cleaning-day followed in schools every week, every waste generator to be responsible for keeping the country clean and contributing to waste management, starting from Govt. sector.\n\n7. Penalization system: Fines to be imposed and no waste collection for buildings not segregating waste at source as punishment.\n\n8. Waste Management Facilities to be made available in every ULB:\n\n  i. Biomethanization plant\n\n  ii. W-to-E plant\n\n  iii. Multiple Recycling centres for different types of waste\n\n  iv. Scrap collection shops – Online app based\n\n9. Complete Digital App-based system for:\n\n  i. Training of all Waste Generators\n\n  ii. Shopping of Waste utilities – compost kits, dustbins, etc.\n\n  iii. Tracking of Waste collection vehicles\n\n  iv. Location of Waste management facilities, Recycling centres, scrap shops etc.\n\n  v. Option to upload geo-tagged photos of dumping sites, etc.",

The platform should allow users to input data, use AI/ML to predict environmental and circularity indicators, visualize circular flow opportunities, and generate actionable reports.",
    "description": "Background\n\nAs industries increasingly emphasize sustainability, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is emerging not just as a tool for measuring environmental impact, but as a key strategy for advancing circularity. Metals like aluminium and copper, vital to sectors from energy to infrastructure, undergo multiple stages — from extraction and processing to use and end-of-life. Traditional linear models often result in resource depletion and waste. Modern LCA frameworks now assess not only emissions and resource use, but also the potential for reuse, recycling, and closed-loop systems. By informing decisions on product design, manufacturing, and end-of-life recovery, LCA enables a shift toward a circular economy where materials are kept in use longer and waste is minimized.\n\nProblem Statement\n\nThere is a need to design an intuitive, AI-powered software platform that enables metallurgists, engineers, and decision-makers to perform automated LCAs for metals such as aluminium, copper, or critical minerals, with a special emphasis on circularity.\n\nProposed Solution\n\nThe platform should:\n\n- Allow users to input or select process and production details (including raw vs. recycled routes, energy use, transport, and end-of-life options).\n\n- Use AI/ML models to estimate missing parameters and predict both environmental and circularity indicators (e.g., recycled content, resource efficiency, extended product life, potential for reuse).\n\n- Visualize circular flow opportunities alongside environmental impacts across the full value chain — from raw material extraction through reuse or recycling.\n\n- Enable easy comparison of conventional and circular processing pathways.\n\n- Generate actionable reports and recommendations for reducing impacts and enhancing circularity, even when users have limited data or specialized expertise.\n\nImpact\n\nWith this tool, the metals sector will be empowered to make practical, data-driven choices that foster environmental sustainability while advancing circular, resource-efficient systems.",

    "summary": "Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) faces a document overload problem, hindering decision-making and operational efficiency. The challenge involves creating a system to condense, contextualize, and route critical information from various sources to relevant stakeholders.",
    "description": "Since its first commercial run in 2017, KMRL has grown into a complex, multidisciplinary enterprise that stretches far beyond train operations. Every business day the organization generates and receives thousands of pages of material: engineering drawings, maintenance job cards, incident reports, vendor invoices, purchase-order correspondence, regulatory directives, environmental-impact studies, safety circulars, HR policies, legal opinions, and board-meeting minutes. These arrive through e-mail, Maximo exports, SharePoint repositories, WhatsApp PDFs, hard-copy scans, and ad-hoc cloud links—often in both English and Malayalam, sometimes in bilingual hybrids, frequently with embedded tables, photos, or signatures. The sheer diversity and volume have created a silent productivity tax: \n\n● Information latency: Front-line managers spend hours skimming lengthy documents for the few actionable lines that affect their shift, delaying decisions on train availability, contractor payments, or staffing reallocations. \n\n● Siloed awareness: Procurement may negotiate a spare-parts contract without realizing that Engineering has already flagged an upcoming design change HR may schedule refresher training unaware of a new safety bulletin released the previous evening.\n\n● Compliance exposure: Regulatory updates from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety and the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs are buried in inboxes, risking missed deadlines or audit non-conformities. \n\n● Knowledge attrition: Institutional memory remains locked in static files when key personnel transfer or retire, hard-won insights vanish with them. \n\n● Duplicated effort: Different teams independently create summaries or slide decks of the same source documents, multiplying manual work and version-control headaches. \n\nAs KMRL prepares to expand its corridor, add two new depots, and integrate emerging technologies such as Unified Namespace (UNS) data streams and IoT condition monitoring, the documentary burden will only intensify. Without an organization-wide mechanism to condense, contextualize, and route critical information, the metro risks slower decision cycles, avoidable operating costs, diminished service reliability, and heightened safety and legal vulnerabilities. The challenge, therefore, is to equip every stakeholder—from station controllers and rolling-stock engineers to finance officers and executive directors—with rapid, trustworthy snapshots of the documents that matter to them, while preserving traceability to the original source. Solving this problem will unlock faster cross-department coordination, strengthen regulatory compliance, safeguard institutional knowledge, and ultimately support KMRL’s mission of delivering safe, efficient, and passenger-centric urban transit to Kochi.",

    "summary": "Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) needs an AI-driven platform to optimize train induction planning and scheduling. The current manual process is inefficient and error-prone, leading to issues with punctuality, maintenance costs, and branding commitments. The platform should integrate data, enforce constraints, generate optimized schedules, and learn from historical data.",
    "description": "Kochi Metro must decide every night which of its 25 four-car trainsets will enter revenue service at dawn, which remain on standby, and which are held back in the Inspection Bay Line (IBL) for maintenance. The decision hinges on six inter-dependent variables: \n\n1. Fitness Certificates – validity windows issued by Rolling-Stock, Signalling and Telecom departments.\n\n2. Job-Card Status – open vs. closed work orders exported from IBM Maximo. \n\n3. Branding Priorities – contractual commitments that dictate exterior wrap exposure hours. \n\n4. Mileage Balancing – kilometre allocation to equalise bogie, brake-pad and HVAC wear. \n\n5. Cleaning & Detailing Slots – available manpower and bay occupancy for interior deep-cleaning. \n\n6. Stabling Geometry – physical bay positions that minimise nightly shunting and morning turn-out time. \n\nAt present these data points reside in siloed spreadsheets, manual logbooks, and daily WhatsApp updates. Supervisors reconcile them in a time-compressed window (21:00–23:00 IST) using ad-hoc filters and experience-based heuristics. The process is opaque, non-repeatable, and highly error-prone:\n\n● Missing a single telecom clearance can force an unscheduled rake withdrawal, eroding the 99.5 % punctuality KPI. \n\n● Uneven mileage assignment accelerates component fatigue, inflating maintenance cost. \n\n● Inadequate visibility into branding priorities risks breaching advertiser SLAs, exposing KMRL to revenue penalties. \n\n● Excessive night-time shunting to rearrange rakes increases energy consumption and track-occupancy safety risk. With fleet size slated to grow to 40 trainsets and two depots by 2027, the existing manual workflow cannot scale linearly—neither in staffing nor in cognitive load. Therefore, KMRL requires an integrated, algorithm-driven decision-support platform that can: \n\n● Ingest heterogeneous inputs (Maximo exports, IoT fitness sensors, UNS streams, manual overrides) in near-real-time. \n\n● Enforce rule-based constraints and multi-objective optimisation (service readiness, reliability, cost, branding exposure). \n\n● Generate a ranked induction list with explainable reasoning, conflict alerts, and “what-if” simulation. \n\n● Learn from historical outcomes via machine-learning feedback loops to improve forecast accuracy over time. \n\nSuch a system will transform induction planning from a manual reconciliation exercise into a reproducible, auditable, data-driven process—delivering higher fleet availability, lower lifecycle cost, and an enhanced passenger experience while freeing operations staff to focus on strategic exceptions rather than routine data wrangling.",

    "description": "Background:\n\nWith the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, all higher education institutions-including Institutes of Teacher Education and general degree colleges-have transitioned to Four-Year Undergraduate Programmes (FYUP) and integrated teacher education programs like B.Ed., M.Ed., and ITEP. These programs feature flexible, creditbased, multidisciplinary structures allowing students to choose Major, Minor, Skill-Based, Ability Enhancement, and Value-Added courses. Manual timetable creation under this new framework has become extremely complex, involving numerous subject combinations, varying credit hours, student preferences, and faculty workload distribution. To manage this, colleges usually form dedicated timetable committees, but even then, clashes, underutilization of faculty, and scheduling inefficiencies persist.\n\nDescription:\n\nThis problem statement envisions the development of a web-based or hybrid intelligent system that can generate automated, conflict-free, optimized academic timetables alignment with the NEP 2020 course structure. The system must integrate:\n\n- Student data (elective choices, enrolled credits)\n\n- Curriculum structure (course codes, credits, theory/practical split)\n\n- Faculty workload, availability, and expertise\n\n- Room/lab availability and capacity\n\n- Teaching practice schedules (especially relevant for B.Ed. and M.Ed.)\n\n- Field work, internships, and project components\n\nThe system should also allow dynamic editing, scenario simulation, and scalability for upcoming semesters. A user-friendly admin interface is essential to allow real-time inputs and updates.\n\nExpected Solution:\n\nA deployable AI/ML-assisted Timetable Generator that:\n\n- Accepts structured inputs from academic, student, and faculty databases\n\n- Generates a semester-wise timetable for multiple programs (B.Ed., M.Ed., FYUP, ITEP)\n\n- Prevents scheduling conflicts across faculty and infrastructure\n\n- Accommodates future course additions and changing NEP guidelines\n\n- Offers exportable formats (PDF, Excel) for student and faculty sharing\n\n- Can be integrated with existing Academic Management Systems",

    "summary": "The problem is the lack of a centralized digital platform to track and showcase student achievements in higher education institutions, leading to inefficiencies and limitations for students. The solution is to develop a mobile and web application that acts as a Smart Student Hub, managing student records and achievements.",
    "description": "Background:\n\nDespite increasing digitization in education, student achievements ranging from academic excellence to participation in curricular and extracurricular activities remain scattered across various departments or lost in paper-based records, in many colleges and universities. There is no centralized digital platform that enables institutions to document, track, and showcase a student's complete profile, including:\n\n- Conferences and workshops attended\n\n- Certifications earned\n\n- Club activities and volunteering efforts\n\n- Competitions and academic contests\n\n- Leadership roles and internships\n\n- Community services done\n\nThis gap not only hampers institutional efficiency but also limits students' ability to build a verified and dynamic portfolio that could support job applications, higher education admissions, and skill recognition. In addition, during events like NAAC accreditation, the lack of consolidated data becomes a major administrative challenge.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe above problem necessitates the development of a Smart Student Hub (Mobile + Web Application) that acts as a centralized student record and achievement management platform.\n\nKey Features include:\n\n- Dynamic Student Dashboard: Real-time updates on academic performance, attendance, and credit-based activities.\n\n- Activity Tracker: Upload and validate participation in seminars, conferences, online courses (e.g., MOOCs), internships, and extra-curriculars.\n\n- Faculty Approval Panel: Faculty or admin can approve uploaded records to maintain credibility.\n\n- Auto-Generated Digital Portfolio: Downloadable and shareable verified student portfolio in PDF or web link format.\n\n- Analytics & Reporting: For institutions to generate reports for NAAC, AICTE, NIRF, or internal evaluations.\n\n- Integration Support: Can link with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS), ERP, or digital university platforms.\n\nImpact and Benefits:\n\n- Empowers students with a verified, holistic digital profile.\n\n- Facilitates career planning, placements, and scholarship/higher studies applications.\n\n- Reduces administrative burden during audits and accreditations.\n\n- Encourages participation in co-curricular activities by making achievements visible and valued.\n\n- Promotes data-driven decision-making at the institutional level.\n\nExpected Solution:\n\nWe propose the development of a mobile + web-based application that can digitally catalogue and manage a student's academic and non-academic achievements throughout their time in college. The proposed protocol will:\n\n- Build a verified, holistic student profile from Day 1\n\n- Reduce paperwork and improve transparency\n\n- Make students better prepared for placements, fellowships, or postgraduate admissions\n\n- Empower faculty with real-time data for mentoring and tracking\n\n- Align with the digital transformation goals of higher education institutions\n\n- Enhance institutional efficiency during accreditation or policy audits\n\nThis will bridge the gap by offering an all-in-one solution that empowers students, simplifies faculty tasks, and modernizes institutional operations.",

    "summary": "The problem is the decline in student enrollment in government degree colleges due to a lack of awareness about career paths and educational opportunities. The proposed solution is a personalized digital platform that guides students on subject selection, college choices, and career options.",
    "description": "Background\n\nThe decline in student enrollment in government degree colleges is not a consequence of poor infrastructure or lack of teaching resources. At the heart of the problem lies a critical gap in awareness, most students and often their parents do not understand the importance of graduation, what career opportunities different degree courses unlock, or how to choose a subject stream based on personal interest and future prospects. After passing Class 10 or 12, students face confusion about:\n\n- Which subject stream (Arts, Science, Commerce) to opt for.\n\n- What kind of degree programs are available in nearby government colleges.\n\n- What jobs or higher studies they can pursue after choosing a particular course.\n\n- Whether pursuing graduation is even worth the effort, especially when short-term job or skill-based courses seem more accessible.\n\nThis lack of clarity leads to poor academic decisions, dropouts, or migration to private institutions that often promise but fail to deliver quality education.\n\nDescription\n\nThe above problem statement envisages that a customized Digital Guidance Platform for students should be developed as a one-stop personalized career and education advisor.\n\nKey Features of the App/Web Platform:\n\n- Aptitude & Interest-Based Course Suggestion: Short quizzes to assess the student's interests, strengths and personality traits. Based on results, the app will suggest suitable streams and subjects (Arts, Science, Commerce, Vocational). Students can compare career paths based on different combinations.\n\n- Course-to-Career Path Mapping: Detailed visual charts showing what each degree (B.A., B.Sc., B.Com., BBA, etc.) offers. The industries or sectors each course leads to and relevant government exams, private jobs, entrepreneurial options, or higher education available after each stream.\n\n- Nearby Government Colleges Directory: Location-based listing of government colleges, information on available degree programs; cut-offs and eligibility, medium of instruction, facilities (hostel, lab, library, internet access).\n\n- Timeline Tracker: Notification system for admission dates, scholarship application windows, college entrance tests or counseling schedules.\n\n- Customization and Personalization: User profiles created at login — tracking age, gender, class, academic interests. AI-driven recommendation engine suggests:\n\n  • Courses to apply for.\n\n  • Colleges nearby.\n\n  • Career paths aligned with their aptitude.\n\n  • Study materials tailored to subject choice.\n\nImplementation Strategy\n\n- Stakeholder Collaboration: Involve government education departments, school teachers, NGOs, and counselors for content and outreach.\n\n- Technology Development: Partner with EdTech developers to build a scalable, lightweight app with offline features for poor internet areas.\n\n- Pilot Launch: Start in one or two districts with low college enrollment. Get feedback from students and teachers.\n\n- Full-Scale Rollout: Roll out state-wide or nationally through government schools and skill centers.\n\n- Monitoring & Feedback: Real-time analytics to track usage, app suggestions, successful transitions to college enrollment.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nWe propose the development of a mobile + web-based application that acts as a one-stop personalized career and education advisor. The platform will be designed for students guiding them in choosing the right subject combination after class 12th, selecting suitable degree courses in local government colleges, understanding the long-term outcomes of different courses (jobs, entrance exams, skill development) and accessing open-source e-books, skill materials, and scholarships.\n\nImpact\n\n- Improved enrollment in government degree colleges by helping students make informed academic decisions.\n\n- Reduced dropouts after Class 10 and 12.\n\n- Empowered students with access to reliable, localized career guidance.\n\n- Stronger perception of government colleges as viable career-building institutions.",

The goal is to develop toolsets and workflows that incorporate features like potholes and erratic driver behavior, improving traffic management and infrastructure planning.",
    "description": "Urban traffic congestion in Indian cities is worsened by the limitations of current urban planning software, which often assumes ideal, well-maintained road conditions typical of developed countries. Such software fails to account for the unpredictable and nuanced realities of Indian roads—such as potholes, temporary barricades, partial lane closures, construction activities, and erratic driver behaviors.\n\nManually modeling these complex and dynamic road features into digital twins for realistic traffic simulations is both tedious and time-consuming, often requiring significant engineering effort before any meaningful simulation can be conducted.\n\nTo address this challenge, MathWorks is seeking innovative solutions to accelerate the creation of highly detailed digital twins of existing Indian road junctions and networks. The aim is to design toolsets, templates, asset libraries, or workflows—leveraging MATLAB, Simulink, Automated Driving Toolbox, RoadRunner, and potentially generative AI—that significantly streamline the process.\n\nThe solution should enable users to easily incorporate typical Indian road features and simulate hyper-local vehicular behaviors in their modeling, thereby empowering traffic management agencies to run realistic simulations for crisis handling, congestion management, and infrastructure planning.\n\nProposals should focus on enhancing the modeling process rather than traffic optimization and must integrate seamlessly with MATLAB-based simulation workflows.\n\nFor more information on relevant tools, please refer to the following links:\n\nDriving Scenario Designer – Design driving scenarios, configure sensors, and generate synthetic data – MATLAB\n\nhttps://in.mathworks.com/help/driving/ref/drivingscenariodesigner-app.html?requestedDomain=\n\nGitHub - MathWorks/OpenTrafficLab\n\nhttps://github.com/mathworks/OpenTrafficLab\n\nCreate Driving Scenario Variations Programmatically – MATLAB & Simulink\n\nhttps://in.mathworks.com/help/driving/ug/create-driving-scenario-variations-programmatically.html?requestedDomain=\n\nSensor Simulation and Virtual Scene Design with the Driving Scenario Designer App, Part 1 – MATLAB\n\nhttps://in.mathworks.com/videos/driving-scenario-designer-1529302116471.html?s_tid=srchtitle_videos_main_1_driving+scenario\n\nImport OpenStreetMap Data into Driving Scenario – MATLAB & Simulink\n\nhttps://in.mathworks.com/help/driving/ug/import-openstreetmap-data-into-driving-scenario.html",

    "description": "Background:\n\nRural diploma colleges often operate without subject Lecturers in various fields\n\nsuch as artificial intelligence, VLSI, or renewable energy. Students must rely on self-study material or travel to cities for coaching,deepening the urban-rural learning divide.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe challenge is less about willingness than about infrastructure. Typical village campuses juggle low and unstable data speeds, making conventional video-conferencing unreliable. Previous interventions failed when platforms assumed  high-bandwidth links or required complicated equipment. To succeed, a new approach must embrace low-bandwidth realities, prioritise audio quality, compress visual content, and ensure that learning can continue even during connectivity lapses. It should encourage synchronous interaction yet also provide recordings that remain small enough for easy download on limited data plans. Faculty in cities need a simple way to deliver lectures from any quiet corner, while rural students require a user experience that functions on entry-level smartphones. Interactive elements quizzes, polls, discussion boards-must remain functional at low speeds.Crucially, the entire solution should minimise the leaming curve for educators and be financially sustainable for resource-constrained institutes. By offering a design that blends live engagement with asynchronous access, the college can bring expert instruction to every campus without waiting for large capital investments.This is precisely the sort of context-aware challenge that Smart India Hackathon teams can address through innovative but lightweight software solutions.\n\nExpected Solution:\n\nStudent teams should outline a software-only virtual-classroom ecosystem that delivers clear audio and concise visual content on limited bandwidth, supports interactive live as well as recorded sessions, and allows easy content access for learners who may need to download materials during off-peak hours-all without relying on specialised hardware or costly licences.",

    "summary": "The problem involves creating an AI-based system to predict student drop-out risk by analyzing attendance, assessment scores, and fee payment data. The system should consolidate data from various spreadsheets, apply rule-based thresholds to identify at-risk students, and notify mentors for early intervention.",
    "description": "Background:\n\nBy the time term-end marks reveal failures, many struggling students have disengaged beyond recovery. Counsellors and mentors need a mechanism that surfaces risk indicators-faliing attendance, high number of attempts exhausted to pass a particular subject, reducing test scores-weeks earlier.\n\nDescription:\n\nAttendance percentages live in one spreadsheet, test results in another, and fee-payment data in a third. No single view exists to signal that a learner is slipping in multiple areas simultaneously.\n\nCommercial analytics platforms promise predictive insights but demand funds and maintenance beyond the reach of public institutes. A simpler, transparent approach would merge existing spreadsheets,apply clear logic to colour-code risk,and notify mentors on a predictable schedule.Such a system\n\nmust be easy to configure, require minimal training, and empower educators-not replace their judgment. By focusing on data fusion and timely alerts rather than complex algorithms, the institute can intervene early and reduce drop-out rates without fresh budget lines.This challenge epitomises the hackathon spirit: take what is already present, integrate it cleverly, and produce meaningful impact using\n\nmachine learning.\n\nExpected SoIution:\n\nParticipants  are expected to build a consolidated digitaI dashboard that automatically ingests attendance,assessment scores, and other student related dala;applies clear, rule-based  thresholds to identify at-risk students; highIights them in an intuitive visual format; and dispatches regular notifications to mentors and guardians, ensuring early,data-driven intervention achieved entirely through suitable machine learning approaches.",

    "summary": "The problem involves creating an integrated student management system for a college using readily available cloud-based tools to streamline admissions, fee collection, hostel allocation, and examination records. The goal is to eliminate manual data entry, provide real-time institutional overview, and improve efficiency without the high cost of a full ERP suite.",
    "description": "Background:\n\nAdmissions, fee collection, hostel allocation, and examination records are maintained in separate ledgers. Students queue at multiple counters; staff re-enter identical data; and administrators lack a real-time institutional overview.\n\nDescription:\n\nComprehensive ERP suites can unify data but remain out of financial reach for many public colleges. Yet much of the required functionality-customised online forms, central data tables, automated receipts, real-time dashboards-already exists in ubiquitous cloud office suites. By intelligently connecting these services, an institution can create a single source of truth without large capital outlay. Essential components include streamlined admission intake, automated fee receipting, live hostel occupancy tracking, and summary dashboards for higher officials. Data security, role-based access and regular back-ups must be baked in from day one. Because staff is already familiar with basic spreadsheet and form tools, the learning curve remains shallow, ensuring broad adoption. Hackathon participants can demonstrate how thoughtful process mapping and lightweight scripting turn an assortment of familiar apps into a cohesive, low-cost ERP that any college can replicate.

    "description": "Background:\n\nCampus offices answer hundreds of repetitive queries-fee deadlines, scholarship forms, timetable changes often from students more comfortable in Hindi or other regional languages. Long queues and communication gaps strain both staff and learners..\n\nDescription:\n\nWhile answers reside in circulars and PDFs, students prefer conversational guidance. A multilingual chatbot that understands Hindi, English, and an additional local language can deflect routine inquiries, freeing staff for complex tasks. Modern conversational-Al services offer drag-and-drop interfaces. Key requirements include accurate intent recognition, context management across multiple turns, fallback to human contact when necessary, and daily conversation logs for continuous improvement. Embedding the chatbot on the college website and popular messaging platforms maximises reach. Crucially, the solution must respect privacy, ensure response accuracy, and remain maintainable by student volunteers after the hackathon concludes. By focusing on content curation and user-centric design, participants can deliver high impact solution quickly.\n\nExpected Solution:\n\nStudent innovators should develop a multilingual conversational assistant that ingests institutional FAQs, recognises and responds to student queries in at least five regional languages, maintains context across follow-up questions, logs interactions for review, and integrates seamlessly into the college's existing web and messaging channels-achieving equitable, round-the-clock information access in a user friendly manner.",

It involves digitizing legacy data, creating an interactive atlas, mapping assets using AI and satellite data, and building a DSS to recommend and layer government schemes for FRA holders.",
    "description": "Problem Background :\n\nThe Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006 recognizes the rights of forest-dwelling communities over land and forest resources. However, significant challenges persist:\n\n• Legacy records of Individual Forest Rights (IFR), Community Rights (CR), and Community Forest Resource Rights (CFR) are scattered, non-digitized, and difficult to verify.\n\n• There is no centralized, real-time visual repository (e.g., an FRA Atlas) of FRA claims and granted titles.\n\n• Integration of satellite-based asset mapping (land, water bodies, farms, etc.) with FRA data is missing.\n\n• Integration of legacy data with FRA Atlas is missing.\n\n• Decision-makers lack a Decision Support System (DSS) to layer Central Sector Schemes (CSS) benefits (e.g., PM-KISAN, Jal Jeevan Mission, MGNREGA, DAJGUA (3 ministries)) for FRA patta holders.\n\nProject Objectives\n\n1. Digitize and standardize legacy data of FRA claims, verifications, and pattas, and integrate with FRA Atlas. FRA patta holders’ shapefiles to be integrated.\n\n2. Create an FRA Atlas showing potential and granted FRA areas using AI and satellite data.\n\n3. Integrate a WebGIS portal to visualize and manage spatial and socio-economic data.\n\n4. Use Remote Sensing and AI/ML to map capital and social assets (ponds, farms, forest resources) of FRA-holding villages.\n\n5. Build a Decision Support System (DSS) to recommend and layer CSS schemes based on mapped data, enhancing targeted development.\n\nAI & Tech Components\n\n1. Data Digitization\n\n• Use suitable models to extract and standardize text from scanned FRA documents.\n\n• Apply Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify village names, patta holders, coordinates, and claim status.\n\n2.

    "summary": "The project aims to develop a real-time pressure measurement device, \"Spinobar\", for spinal orthoses to improve patient outcomes. The device will use a sensor array to provide non-invasive, real-time data on pressure distribution, enabling personalized orthotic adjustments and biomechanical research. The goal is to create a cost-effective and easy-to-use solution to overcome limitations of current methods.",
    "description": "Background\n\nSpinal orthoses play a vital role in posture correction and rehabilitation, but their success depends on accurate force application. Conventional assessment methods are often subjective, invasive, or lack precision, leading to discomfort, poor compliance, and limited treatment outcomes. Existing imported systems are costly and not tailored for spinal applications, restricting clinical use. Hence, there is a pressing need for an indigenous, cost-effective, and reliable device that can measure orthotic forces in real time, supporting personalized care and biomechanical research.\n\nDescription\n\nThe project involves the design and development of an innovative pressure measurement device, initially named as “Spinobar”, tailored to assess forces applied by spinal orthoses. Traditional measurement techniques often lack specificity and fail to capture localized pressure variations, leading to limitations in orthotic design and patient outcomes. Existing systems are either prohibitively expensive or not optimized for spinal care, creating a critical gap in clinical practice.\n\nThe Spinobar integrates a high-sensitivity sensor array embedded into orthotic materials to provide non-invasive, real-time data on pressure distribution. By offering an accurate, cost-effective, and easy-to-use solution, this device enables clinicians to personalize orthotic adjustments, optimize therapeutic forces, and ensure greater patient comfort and compliance. Additionally, the device holds potential as a research tool, promoting innovation in biomechanical studies and the development of next-generation spinal orthoses.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nThe proposed solution is an innovative device, Spinobar, designed to overcome the limitations of current pressure measurement methods in spinal orthoses. It will employ sensitive sensors to capture localized forces non-invasively, providing real-time data that clinicians can use for adjustments. Its affordability and portability will make it suitable for routine clinical practice. By ensuring accurate force application, the device will improve patient comfort, rehabilitation outcomes, and serve as a valuable tool for advancing biomechanical research.",

    "title": "Smart Foldable Aluminium Axillary Crutch with IoT Integration for Enhanced Mobility and Rehabilitation",
    "summary": "This project aims to develop a smart, foldable axillary crutch using lightweight aluminum, incorporating IoT and sensor technology for enhanced mobility and rehabilitation. The crutch will feature shock absorption, ergonomic design, and a mobile app for real-time feedback and fall detection.",
    "description": "Background\n\nConventional axillary crutches are widely used for temporary or permanent lower-limb impairments; however, they present several challenges, including bulkiness, lack of portability, discomfort due to axillary nerve compression, and the absence of real-time feedback for rehabilitation. Although the initial project successfully demonstrated a foldable stainless-steel crutch, the heavier weight limited its suitability for elderly and long-term users. Emerging technologies in lightweight materials, IoT-enabled healthcare, and smart rehabilitation devices offer an opportunity to reimagine the design of crutches.\n\nBy switching to aluminium alloys, the device can be made lighter without compromising durability. Further, by embedding sensors, shock-absorbing dampers, reflective safety features, and IoT connectivity, the crutch can evolve from a mechanical support into a smart rehabilitation companion that enhances safety, comfort, and clinical monitoring.\n\nDescription\n\nThis project proposes the development of a next-generation foldable axillary crutch using lightweight aluminium alloy as the primary structural material. Aluminium will significantly reduce the overall weight of the crutch, improving usability for elderly and frail patients while maintaining adequate load-bearing capacity. The foldable design, refined from the stainless-steel prototype, will retain its compactness and ergonomic efficiency, making it highly portable for users who travel or live in compact environments.\n\nTo address the issue of upper-limb strain, the new design will incorporate shock-absorbing dampers at the base of the shaft, reducing impact forces transmitted to the shoulders and wrists. Ergonomic improvements such as anatomically contoured handgrips, adjustable padding, and modular replaceable parts will ensure sustained comfort and adaptability.\n\nThe innovation lies in the integration of IoT and sensor-based technologies. Embedded force and motion sensors will monitor weight distribution, gait pattern, and posture. Data will be transmitted wirelessly to a mobile application, where users and clinicians can track mobility progress, receive real-time feedback, and identify risks of incorrect usage. A fall-detection system with alert notifications will enhance safety for geriatric and high-risk users.\n\nAdditionally, radium reflective tape will be applied on the crutch frame to improve visibility during low-light or nighttime conditions. This simple yet effective feature will help prevent accidents in outdoor environments and improve user safety in traffic-prone areas.\n\nThe envisioned solution aligns with the growing demand for inclusive, tech-enabled assistive devices that combine portability, ergonomics, safety, and intelligence. It offers significant potential for use in post-operative care, neurological rehabilitation, elderly mobility, and disaster-relief scenarios, contributing to the next generation of accessible healthcare technologies.\n\nExpected Solution\n\n* Lightweight aluminium foldable crutch with improved portability.\n\n* Shock-absorbing dampers to reduce upper limb strain.\n\n* IoT-enabled sensors for gait monitoring, posture analysis, and fall detection.\n\n* Mobile app integration for data visualisation, rehab tracking, and alerts.\n\n* Modular and customizable components for sustainability and user comfort.\n\n* Radium reflective tape for night-time visibility and enhanced safety.",

    "description": "Background\n\nThe Protection of Civil Rights (PCR) Act, 1955 and the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 are landmark legislations aimed at ensuring justice and dignity for historically marginalized communities. The Centrally Sponsored Scheme for the effective implementation of this Acts, provide central assistance to States/UTs for strengthening the enforcement and monitoring machinery, creating awareness, relief and rehabilitation of victims, and incentives for inter-caste marriages.\n\nAt present, disbursement of monetary reliefs and to the victim and incentive for inter-caste marriages under the Scheme is routed through State Governments/UT Administrations. The process is largely manual except some states are using their own portal. The manual process is reported to be time-consuming and prone to procedural delays.\n\nThe Challenge\n\nDevise smart, tech-enabled modalities to effectively implement DBT under scheme related to the PCR and PoA Acts, ensuring:\n\n• Ensuring accurate identification and verification of Victim;\n\n• Facilitating real-time tracking of sanction, disbursement and utilization of funds;\n\n• Safeguarding privacy and data security of victims;\n\n• Promoting transparency and accountability in the transfer of financial assistance;\n\n• Establishing mechanisms to prevent delays and misallocation of funds;\n\n• Enabling integration with existing national databases such as Aadhaar, DigiLocker, eCourts, Crime and Criminal Tracking Network Systems (CCTNS), etc.\n\n• Providing accessibility and ease of availing benefits for beneficiaries residing in remote, rural and tribal areas.\n\nExpected Outcomes\n\nParticipants are expected to develop:\n\n• A prototype system, mobile/web-based application, or dashboard for effective management of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) under the PCR/PoA Scheme;\n\n• Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or integration frameworks for seamless coordination among District Authorities, Social Welfare Departments, and Financial Institutions;\n\n• A grievance redressal or beneficiary feedback module\n\nImpact\n\nThe proposed solution is expected to facilitate timely delivery of relief and assistance to victims of caste-based discrimination and atrocities, thereby upholding their right to justice and dignity ensuring the availability of data at one place. It would further strengthen public trust in the enforcement framework, enhance transparency and accountability in welfare delivery, and contribute towards making the system more inclusive, efficient and technology-driven.",

    "summary": "The problem is the ineffectiveness of current anti-phishing systems against sophisticated and evolving cyber threats. The goal is to develop a real-time phishing detection and prevention framework using AI/ML, NLP, and graph-based analytics.",
    "description": "Background:\n\nPhishing attacks have evolved into highly sophisticated cyber threats exploiting human psychology, weak security configurations, and gaps in legacy detection mechanisms. Threat actors now leverage Machine learning (ML), Deep learning (DL), and natural language generation (NLG) to create context-aware phishing campaigns that bypass signature- and rule-based security systems. Attack vectors are no longer limited to email; they now span SMS, instant messaging platforms, and websites using domain spoofing, homoglyph attacks, and redirection chains. The dynamic and polymorphic nature of these attacks has rendered traditional anti-phishing mechanisms—such as static URL blacklists, regex-based filters, and signature matching—ineffective against zero-day exploits.\n\nProblem Statement:\n\nCurrent anti-phishing ecosystems lack the technical adaptability and intelligence required to detect and mitigate emerging threats in real time. The main technical limitations include:\n\n• Static Detection Models: Legacy tools rely on rule-based engines and signature libraries that fail against dynamically generated URLs, short-lived domains, and polymorphic attack payloads.\n\n• Insufficient NLP/ML Analysis: Many systems lack advanced contextual and semantic analysis, resulting in undetected threats embedded in AI-generated or obfuscated messages.\n\n• Complex Link Obfuscation: Phishing URLs often employ techniques like multiple HTTP 3xx redirection hops, Base64/hex encoding, and URL parameter cloaking, evading traditional scanners.\n\n• Latency in Detection: Many security platforms perform post-delivery scans or asynchronous sandboxing, providing alerts after the end-user has engaged with the malicious link or attachment.\n\n• Poor Model Generalization: ML classifiers trained on historical datasets often exhibit model drift and fail to generalize to zero-day phishing campaigns without active retraining pipelines.\n\n• Limited Endpoint and Browser Integration: Available solutions are primarily cloud- or gateway-based, lacking lightweight real-time integrations with browsers, mail clients, and endpoint security agents.\n\nThe inability to provide real-time, adaptive, and explainable threat detection significantly increases the probability of credential harvesting, session hijacking, ransomware deployment, and large-scale data breaches.\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nWe propose the development of a real-time phishing detection and prevention framework powered by deep learning, advanced NLP, and graph-based analytics, designed to integrate seamlessly into enterprise environments and end-user platforms.\n\nKey components include:\n\n• Multi-Modal Data Analysis:\n\n➢ Textual Analysis: Transformer-based NLP models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) for semantic and syntactic parsing of email bodies, headers, and SMS content.\n\n➢ Visual/Structural Analysis: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze webpage DOM structures, rendering patterns, and brand impersonation markers.\n\n• Graph-Based Link and Domain Analysis:\n\n➢ Graph neural networks (GNNs) for relationship mapping between domains, subdomains, WHOIS records, SSL fingerprints, and DNS history.\n\n➢ Identification of hidden malicious infrastructure through link traversal and detection of domain clustering patterns.\n\n• Adversarial Detection Layer:\n\n➢ Models trained to detect anomalies in AI-generated phishing content, leveraging embeddings from large language models and classifiers fine-tuned for adversarial intent detection.\n\n• Continuous Learning Pipeline:\n\n➢ Online training pipelines for incremental learning from live threat feeds, user feedback, and new IOCs (Indicators of Compromise).\n\n➢ Automated retraining and validation workflows to prevent model drift.\n\n• Edge and Endpoint Integration:\n\n➢ Lightweight browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, integrating with email clients like Outlook and Gmail.\n\n➢ Real-time local inference for sub-50 ms decision latency to ensure seamless user experience.\n\n• Threat Intelligence & Sandbox Integration:\n\n➢ Bidirectional integration with open-source threat intelligence feeds (MISP, AlienVault OTX) and dynamic sandbox environments for behavioural analysis of links and attachments.\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n\n• Detection Accuracy: Over 95% true positive rate with a false-positive rate below 2%, validated through large-scale datasets and red-team simulations.\n\n• Zero-Day Readiness: Adaptive ML pipelines enabling near-instant detection of emerging phishing campaigns.\n\n• Scalability: Cloud-native microservice architecture supporting enterprise-wide deployments and individual user integration.\n\n• Operational Efficiency: Real-time alerts (<100 ms latency) without impacting system performance.\n\n• Cross-Sector Usability: A unified security tool applicable to educational institutions, SMBs, large enterprises, and government agencies.",

    "description": "Background:\n\nThe rapid proliferation of cloud-native infrastructures, remote workforce environments, and IoT/IIoT ecosystems has rendered traditional stateful firewalls obsolete. Static rule-based inspection mechanisms are inadequate to detect polymorphic malware, encrypted command-and-control (C2) channels, supply chain attacks, and zero-day exploits that leverage advanced evasion techniques. Attackers increasingly use AI-driven offensive tools, adversarial machine learning (AML), and living-off-the-land (LotL) strategies to bypass legacy defences.\n\nFurthermore, TLS/SSL encryption now accounts for over 80% of network traffic, severely limiting visibility for signature-based firewalls. The shift toward Zero Trust Network Architecture (ZTNA) — characterized by continuous verification, micro-segmentation, and least-privilege enforcement — demands a context-aware, dynamically adaptive security system capable of real-time threat intelligence and proactive remediation.\n\nProblem Statement:\n\nCurrent NGFWs lack cognitive capabilities for advanced pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and real-time automated mitigation. Limitations include:\n\n• Inability to de-anonymize and analyze encrypted traffic (TLS 1.3, QUIC) without compromising performance.\n\n• Static security policies that cannot dynamically adapt to new Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) or MITRE ATT&CK® TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).\n\n• Minimal integration with Zero Trust principles, leaving organizations vulnerable to insider threats and credential abuse.\n\n• Limited utilization of cloud-scale AI/ML for federated learning and predictive analytics, resulting in delayed or insufficient responses to emerging attack vectors.\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nDesign and develop an AI-powered Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) that integrates Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and graph-based anomaly detection for intelligent, context-aware security enforcement. The system will include:\n\nAdvanced Traffic Analysis:\n\n• Deploy Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) combined with SSL/TLS inspection powered by Lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify encrypted traffic with minimal latency.\n\n• Integrate unsupervised clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Isolation Forest) for anomaly detection in real-time data streams.\n\nZero Trust Integration:\n\n• Enforce adaptive policy control using risk-based authentication (RBA) and behavioural biometrics for user and device verification.\n\n• Implement micro-segmentation at the software-defined perimeter (SDP) level to contain lateral movement.\n\nFederated AI for Threat Intelligence:\n\n• Use federated learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow Federated, PySyft) to share anonymized model updates across distributed NGFW deployments while maintaining data privacy.\n\n• Correlate external threat intelligence feeds (STIX/TAXII standards) with internal telemetry for predictive defence and proactive rule updates.\n\nAutomated Incident Response:\n\n• Integrate Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) workflows to trigger automated containment, quarantine, or sandboxing of malicious entities.\n\n• Utilize reinforcement learning models to optimize firewall rule sets dynamically based on evolving attack patterns.\n\nUnified Visibility and Analytics:\n\n• Provide a real-time security operations dashboard with advanced visualization of attack graphs, anomaly heatmaps, and threat correlation matrices.\n\n• Support integration with SIEM/SOAR platforms like Splunk, ELK, or Azure Sentinel via APIs for centralized monitoring.\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n\n• A production-ready prototype demonstrating:\n\n➢ Sub-second detection and mitigation latency for threats, including zero-day attacks and polymorphic malware.\n\n➢ Seamless enforcement of Zero Trust principles with adaptive access controls.\n\n➢ Predictive threat modelling powered by continuous learning pipelines.\n\n➢ High throughput performance validated through benchmarks (≥40 Gbps inspection with <1ms latency) for enterprise-scale environments.\n\n• Compatibility across multi-cloud, hybrid, and on-premise deployments with support for edge computing in IoT/IIoT ecosystems.\n\n• Compliance with standards such as NIST SP 800-207, ISO/IEC 27001, and MITRE ATT&CK framework.",

    "description": "Description\n\nThe AOI based system should able to capture the IC part marking and verify the markings with the OEM given sequence.\n\nBackground:\n\nIn huge volume electronics equipment production, a large number of ICs from various OEMs are being used. Some of the ICs procurement may be in few lakhs quantities. Due to L1 basis of procurement process, it's possible some of the IC's are fake. Currently our internal QA team checks these markings on sampling basis. This is time consuming and a manual process. In addition, since it is done on sample basis it is possible some of the fake components still get through. Since it's done manually, it's prone to human errors also.\n\nDetailed Description:\n\nIdentification of fake components in large volume production is a time consuming process. The Quality Assurance(QA) personnel do it manually by checking with the documents uploaded by the design team. Sometimes, the fake IC may be mixed with genuine ICs to increase the profit margins. When the boards with the fake components fail, it becomes tedious for the testing and the design team to identify the root cause of the issue as fake IC being used. This causes inordinate delay in production leading to loss in profits, due to LD cause.\n\nExpected Solution:\n\nAn automated inspection system that can continuously scan the IC markings, compare with the marking details from the OEM datasheet and declare if the components are genuine or fake. Sometimes these details are given in a separate document by the OEM on their website. The system should also be intelligent enough to query on the internet and identify the document, download and search the relevant section to identify the part marking details for a particular IC package.",

    "summary": "The problem focuses on developing a decentralized swarm maneuver algorithm for autonomous drones to neutralize adversarial drone swarms and protect ground assets. The algorithm must enable drones to collaboratively engage hostile drones using effective swarming maneuvers, prioritizing the protection of designated ground assets. The solution should be decentralized and robust, functioning even in communication-denied environments.",
    "description": "Background\n\nModern armed conflicts increasingly involve the deployment of autonomous drones for surveillance, reconnaissance, and offensive operations. Currently, most anti-drone strategies rely on traditional Air Defence systems or Electronic Warfare techniques such as jamming. However, these methods may be limited in effectiveness, scalability, or cost. An alternative is to use autonomous drone swarms to counter adversarial drone swarms, leveraging decentralized coordination, adaptive behaviour, and real-time decision-making to neutralize threats more efficiently.\n\nDetailed Description\n\nTo develop an effective solution for autonomous swarm-based drone counter engagement, the following assumptions and requirements must be considered:\n\n1. Armament Capability: Each drone is with armament capability. It is to be assumed that the adversary's drones are also similarly armed.\n\n2. Environmental Perception: Drones must be equipped with appropriate sensors (e.g., Radar, LiDAR, Vision systems) to detect and track other drones within their operational vicinity. Additionally, drones should be able to classify targets as friendly or hostile based on sensor inputs and identification protocols.\n\n3. Swarm Coordination Algorithm: A robust and efficient algorithm is required to coordinate the swarm in real time. This algorithm should enable autonomous drones to collaboratively execute efficient manoeuvres for engaging hostile drones and optimise the overall effectiveness of the swarm in tackling threat from hostile drones. Effectiveness means protecting ground assets and minimizing loss of friendly drones.\n\nThe primary objective of this problem is to develop a decentralized swarm manoeuvre algorithm for autonomous drones operating in a protective role. The algorithm should enable drones to collectively execute swarming manoeuvres—swarming means quickly bringing more forces together against a smaller enemy to gain an advantage, while staying away from battles where the enemy has more troops.\n\nThe protective drone swarm's mission is to protect designated ground assets from hostile drone swarms. Therefore, the algorithm must ensure that no enemy drone with ground attack capabilities* is left unattended** if it is within a threatening range*** of any friendly asset. Prioritization and dynamic threat assessment are critical.\n\nGiven the inherent complexity and scalability challenges of centralized control, the swarm must operate in a distributed and autonomous manner. The algorithm is to be embedded in each drone individually, enabling local decision-making without reliance on a central controller. While it may be assumed that drones possess inter-drone and drone-to-ground communication capabilities, the algorithm must be designed to function effectively even in the complete absence of communication. Communication, if available, may be used to enhance performance but should not be a dependency.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nThe expected outcome is a swarm control algorithm that enables friendly autonomous drones to collaboratively engage and neutralize an adversarial drone swarm using effective swarming manoeuvre. The algorithm must prioritize the protection of designated ground assets, ensuring that no enemy drone capable of attacking ground targets is left unattended within a threatening range.\n\nThe solution should be decentralized in nature, allowing each drone to operate autonomously based on its local perception and on-board intelligence. While limited communication between drones and with the ground station can be assumed to be available, the algorithm must not be dependent on continuous communication for core functionality. It should demonstrate robust and satisfactory performance even in communication-denied or degraded environments.\n\nTo validate the solution’s effectiveness, a stochastic simulation framework must be implemented to evaluate the algorithm through executions across a diverse set of scenarios and each scenario being executed multiple times. Furthermore, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) is required to facilitate visual representation and interaction with the simulation results. (For Technical Specifications of Drone Refer Table)\n\n*Ground Attack Capabilities—\n\nEnemy drones are assumed to be of two types.\n\n1. Drones armed with air to air weapon, which will be a threat to friendly drones.\n\n2. Drones with ground attack capability.\n\n**Left Unattended—\n\nAn enemy drone is unattended if there is no friendly drone either in firing range or in a position to intercept on its path to possible ground target.\n\n***Threatening Range—\n\nThreatening range can be defined as 10 times the speed of drone. Because if a drone with ground attacking capability is less than 10 seconds away from ground asset then there may not be sufficient time to intercept and neutralize it.",

    "title": "Optical-Guided Super-Resolution for Thermal IR Imagery",
    "summary": "This problem focuses on developing a deep learning pipeline to generate high-resolution thermal IR imagery by fusing thermal and optical data. The goal is to create super-resolved thermal maps that maintain temperature accuracy while capturing spatial details, addressing challenges like multi-sensor alignment, modality fusion, and thermal image super-resolution.",
    "description": "Background:\n\nThermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing plays a vital role in urban heat island analysis, wildfire detection, and agricultural stress monitoring. However, TIR sensors typically operate at low spatial resolutions (5–10 m), limiting their ability to capture fine-scale variations in surface temperature. In contrast, optical sensors (1–5 m) capture rich spatial details such as edges, textures, and land cover boundaries but lack direct thermal information.\n\nThis mismatch creates a significant challenge: how can we generate high-resolution thermal maps that preserve accurate temperature information while capturing spatial details. A promising solution is to use fusion-based super-resolution, where optical imagery serves as a guide to enhance thermal images.\n\nDetailed Description:\n\nThe problem requires the development of a deep learning pipeline capable of producing super-resolved thermal IR imagery by leveraging both thermal and optical data. The pipeline must address three major challenges:\n\n1.Multi-Sensor Alignment\n\n  -Geometrically co-registering high-resolution optical images with low-resolution TIR data.\n\n2.Fusion of Modalities\n\n  -Effectively combining spatial detail from optical imagery with temperature fidelity from thermal imagery without introducing artifacts.\n\n3.Super-Resolution of Thermal Imagery\n\n  -Up-sampling the coarse thermal data to a finer spatial resolution guided by optical details.\n\nThe generated outputs must be thermally consistent (faithful to real temperature values) and spatially sharp (preserving fine boundaries).This solution has direct applications in urban planning, wildfire management, and precision agriculture.\n\nExpected Solution:\n\nParticipants are expected to design a fusion-based solution that may involve AI/ML methods as well as physics-based approaches to improve the accuracy and reliability of thermal super-resolution. The solution should:\n\n1.Align optical and thermal data accurately, ensuring geometric co-registration between multi-sensor imagery.\n\n2.Leverage optical features (edges, land cover boundaries, textures) to guide the super-resolution process.\n\n3.Preserve thermal fidelity by maintaining physically consistent surface temperatures and avoiding transfer of false textures.\n\n4.Incorporate physics-based priors or models (e.g., radiative transfer, emissivity correction, or energy balance principles) to strengthen the reliability of outputs, especially in regions where optical data may be misleading.\n\n5.Generate high-resolution thermal IR maps that are both physically meaningful and suitable for real-world applications such as urban planning, wildfire monitoring, and precision agriculture.\n\n6.Ensure the solution is computationally efficient and scalable for processing large-area satellite imagery.\n\nEvaluation:\n\nSolutions will be evaluated based on:\n\n●Quantitative Metrics:\n\n○PSNR, SSIM, and RMSE (Kelvin) against reference thermal images.\n\n●Qualitative Metrics:\n\n○Edge sharpness, alignment accuracy, and fusion realism (avoiding optical artifacts).",

However, conventional encryption mechanisms are susceptible to various threats, including eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and data breaches in post quantum era. \n\nQuantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers an unprecedented level of security by distributing secure keys to two users over quantum channel and these keys can be used for encryption to achieve unconditional/enhanced security.\n\nDetailed Description:\n\nThe objective is to develop email client application like Microsoft Outlook (can be named as QuMail) which integrates Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) service with existing email protocols to enhance the security of email communication while maintaining compatibility with widely used email servers (Gmail, yahoo mail etc).\n\nThis application interfaces: \n\n•With KM (Key Manager) for getting the quantum keys using ETSI Protocol and data format of REST-based key delivery APIs (ETSI GS QKD 014)\n\n•With Email servers through standard protocols to utilize email service facility and \n\n•With users through GUI for capturing various user inputs.    \n\nUse case Scenario: \n\n-Users (having quantum keys access through the KM and need not to implement QKD) need to exchange email with attachment over untrusted network (i.e. internet) and existing email service providers (Gmail, Yahoo mail etc). \n\n-It is assumed that local key managers at both ends have already generated symmetrical quantum keys at their ends. The participants may simulate the KM (ref ETSI GS QKD 014) for testing & demonstrating the applications\n\nExpected Solution:\n\nFeatures:   \n\n1.Implemented solutions shall have good modularity to allow easy upgradation \n\n2.KM service and email service login feature\n\n3.Multi level of security configuration: \n\n4.Level 1- Quantum Secure : use One Time Pad No Quantum security \n\n5.Level 2- Quantum-aided AES: use Quantum keys as seed for AES   \n\n6.Level 3- Any other encryption (like PQC) may be given as option\n\n7.Level 4- No Quantum security\n\nChallenges:\n\nDevelop a robust mechanism to seamlessly integrate QKD and Quantum Network technology into existing email infrastructure. This includes using secure key which is distributed using QKD, in existing email communication for encryption while maintaining interoperability. \n\nAn approach to this problem can be: Encryption at application layer can be introduced in email client which will use QKD key.\n\nParticipant may consider keeping the application architecture in such a manner so that it may upgraded to Application Suit by integrating more applications like chat/audio/video calling for peer to peer communication.\n\nPreferred OS: Windows \n\nNote: The participants can make further assumptions regarding the problem. The features listed here are baseline and do not limit the scope of application development.",

    "description": "Description (Background, Detailed Description and Expected Solution):\n\nBackground:\n\nNaCCER, the R&D arm of CIL, plays a pivotal role in fostering research and innovation in the coal sector. It receives a large volume of research proposals from premier institutions across India, for funding by the Ministry of Coal (MoC) and Coal India Limited (CIL). The evaluation process of these proposals is rigorous, involving multiple layers of scrutiny to assess technical feasibility, financial viability, novelty, and relevance to the coal industry. Currently, the initial screening is conducted at NaCCER, followed by expert review within CIL, as per the S&T guidelines. Given the increasing number of proposals and the complexity of manual evaluation, the process is becoming time-intensive and error-prone.\n\nDescription:\n\nAt present, each R&D proposal submitted to NaCCER undergoes comprehensive manual scrutiny. This includes detailed reading, financial assessment, technical feasibility analysis by domain experts within CMPDIL/CIL, and novelty checks using manually maintained Word and Excel databases. These steps demand significant human effort, subjectivity, and time. Moreover, the approval workflow involves apex committee and R&D Board meetings for CIL funding and SSRC/TSC for MoC funding, which meet only a few times a year. Any oversight or missing information during initial scrutiny may result in the rejection of high-potential proposals, or delays due to prolonged correction cycles. These limitations highlight the need for a standardized, efficient, and intelligent evaluation mechanism.\n\nExpected Solution:        \n\nAn AI/ML-based auto-evaluation system can significantly enhance the R&D proposal review process. The system should be capable of benchmarking submitted proposals against a structured database of past and ongoing projects to assess novelty. It should also be able to perform automated financial checks in line with S&T funding guidelines. By generating an objective evaluation score for each proposal, the system will streamline selection and rejection decisions, improve consistency, eliminate manual biases, and reduce processing time. This digitized approach will not only standardize evaluations but also ensure transparency and credibility in the funding decision process.",

There is a need for an automated system to capture ladle numbers, track their real-time location, and determine how many are in circulation. This data must be fed back to a local server for real-time display. Automating this process will enable efficient ladle tracking, improved decision-making based on ladle history, and accurate calculation of metrics like ladle circulation time, turnaround time, and lifespan.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nAutomatically read and capture ladle numbers.Track ladle locations in real time.Display the data on a local server.Enable process optimization using ladle movement and usage data.",

    "description": "Background\n\nFrequency Response Analysis (FRA) is a proven diagnostic technique used to detect mechanical and electrical faults in power transformers, such as core displacement, winding deformation, and insulation degradation. FRA involves injecting a low voltage signal across transformer windings and analysing the resulting frequency spectrum. However, interpretation of FRA signatures is complex, often requiring expert judgment and comparison with baseline data.\n\nCompounding the challenge is the lack of standardization in FRA data formats across different test equipment vendors. Engineers often struggle to consolidate and analyse data from multiple sources, leading to inefficiencies, delayed fault detection, and inconsistent maintenance decisions. There is a critical need for a unified, intelligent software platform that can ingest FRA data from all major formats, perform automated analysis, and deliver actionable insights about probable faults. The solution must leverage AI and machine learning to interpret frequency response signatures with high accuracy, even in the absence of baseline data.\n\nScope of Work\n\nDevelopment of a universal data parser for multi-format FRA inputs.Creation of a labelled dataset of FRA signatures with known fault conditions.Training of AI models (e.g., CNNs, anomaly detection algorithms) for signature classification.Integration of expert system logic for fault interpretation and maintenance guidance.Deployment of a user-friendly interface for field engineers and asset managers.\n\nExpected Solution\n\nTo develop an AI-powered diagnostic software capable of reading and analysing FRA data from diverse sources, identifying potential transformer faults, and recommending corrective actions.

The benefits which will accrue are given as under:\n\nAI systems can analyse video feeds from surveillance cameras, drones, and other sources in real-time, identifying unusual behaviour or potential threats that might be missed by human analysts.AI can be trained to recognize specific objects (weapons, explosives, etc.) and activities (loitering, suspicious movements, etc.) associated with terrorist activities, triggering alerts when detected.Facial recognition technology can be used to identify individuals of interest, compare them against watchlists, and track their movements.\n\nProposed Software Solution\n\nIt is proposed that a software be designed which can take inputs from any surveillance devices, analyse and categorise the information based on the user requirement. This type of software will ensure that even legacy systems can be utilised without the need to upgrade them. The system should have the following capabilities:\n\nVideo Input: Video data will be collected from various sources, such as surveillance cameras, body cams or drones already existing and being used in the NSG. The system should be capable of receiving a wide variety of inputs in different formats.Feature Extraction: Computer vision algorithms will extract relevant features from the video frames, such as objects, patterns or activities. The system should be capable of understanding the user requirement, and should be programmable in an easy manner.Model Training: These extracted features will be fed into AI models (often neural networks) that have been trained on large datasets of labelled video data, which will be done based on NSG's requirement.Analysis and interpretation: The trained AI models will analyse the video in real time or from archived footage, Identifying objects, actions and events.Output: The system will generate various outputs, such as alerts, reports, heatmaps or raw data, depending on the application and user requirement.",

The integrated cabling and compact design also contribute to quicker setup times and easier mobility in confined underground spaces. Additionally, the electric-hydraulic configuration ensures significantly lower energy consumption, translating into operational cost savings and better environmental compliance.\n\nThe system's modular design, along with advanced features like remote control, auto-drilling cycles, and compatibility with digital monitoring systems, further enhances its suitability for modern, semi-automated mining environments. Overall, the EHS Simba drill is engineered to meet the evolving demands of underground mining by offering improved reliability, reduced downtime, and greater safety for operators.\n\nExpected Solution:\n\nThe deployment of Electric Hydraulic System (EHS) based Simba drills in place of conventional pneumatic models serves to enhance drilling operations in underground mining. By leveraging electric-hydraulic technology, the new system will provide faster and more precise drilling performance with significantly improved energy efficiency and operator safety. The EHS drills are expected to reduce operational downtime caused by air hose failures, minimize physical hazards like tripping and high noise exposure, and lower maintenance demands. Additionally, the improved ergonomics and control systems will enhance operator comfort and productivity. This solution aligns with the broader goals of adopting modern, automated, and sustainable mining practices, ultimately leading to increased drilling accuracy, reduced costs, and a safer underground working environment. Comparison Table are attached.\n\nAdvantages of EHS Simba Drill:\n\n1. Enhanced drilling precision and speed.\n\n2. Significant reduction in safety hazards associated with compressed air systems.\n\n3. Improved energy efficiency and environmental compliance.\n\n4. Lower maintenance costs and higher equipment availability.\n\n5. Greater adaptability to modern automated drilling systems.",

    "summary": "The problem is the failure of internship systems in colleges, particularly under the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The proposed solution is a student-industry-college tie-up to develop an app to streamline the internship process.",
    "description": "Background:\n\nThe problem of skill enhancement in colleges is a major issue, especially when it comes to preparing students for the job market. In the context of the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Semester 5 for internships refers to the fifth semester of a 4-year undergraduate degree (typically under the Multidisciplinary Four-Year Undergraduate Programme). Key features of NEP include:\n\n1. Emphasis on Experiential Learning – NEP promotes hands-on learning through internships, fieldwork, and apprenticeships. Semester 5 is typically when students have completed basic foundational and disciplinary courses, and they are ready for practical exposure to apply their knowledge in real-life settings.\n\n2. Timing in the 4-Year Program – In a 4-year UG program: Semester 1-2: Foundation courses; Semester 3-4: Major-specific and interdisciplinary subjects; Semester 5-6: Internships, field projects, or community engagement; Semester 7-8: Research, specialization, or advanced projects. Semester 5 is when students begin industry, research, or community internships to gain practical experience.\n\n3. Flexibility in Internships – Internships may be in industries relevant to the student's major, with NGOs, government departments, or research institutions, and can be short-term (during summer) or extended (as part of credit-based coursework).\n\n4. Credit-Based Evaluation – Internships under NEP can be credit-bearing, i.e., they count towards the student's academic score, and students are often required to submit a report or presentation to reflect learning outcomes.\n\n5. Career Readiness – By Semester 5, students begin career exploration, networking, and gaining experience that prepares them for final-year placements, startups or entrepreneurship, and higher education or research.\n\nIn short, \"Semester 5 for internships\" in NEP means students, by the 5th semester of their undergraduate program, should engage in industry or field-based internships to develop practical skills, gain exposure, and align learning with real-world needs, in line with NEP's emphasis on holistic and experiential education.\n\nThe internship system often fails in colleges—especially under the NEP model—for several critical reasons:\n\n1. Lack of Industry Tie-ups – Limited partnerships with companies, no proper MoUs or placement cells.\n\n2. Poor Planning and Late Implementation – Programs introduced suddenly without planning.\n\n3. No Monitoring or Mentorship – No faculty supervision or follow-up.\n\n4. Students Not Industry-Ready – Lack of skills discourages companies from taking interns.\n\n5. Unavailability of Quality Internships in Rural/Remote Areas – Limited industry presence; ineffective online internships.\n\n6. Administrative and Logistical Failures – Poor coordination, lack of funding, and unclear guidelines.\n\n7. Fake Internships and Certificate Mills – Students buying certificates or joining non-functional organizations.\n\nDescription:\n\nSolution for the gap is student-industry-college tie-up to develop an app for solving internship system failures, which can be a powerful and sustainable solution.\n\nStakeholders & Their Roles\n\n1. Students – Data enrolment in the app, conduct surveys to gather real internship pain points, design and develop the app.\n\n2. College – Provide mentorship and faculty coordinator, offer academic credit for student work (as per NEP), facilitate outreach to companies and sign MoUs, host the app under the institution's digital portal.\n\n3. Industry Partners – Share real-time internship openings, provide API access or dashboards to manage intern applications, offer short-term/remote internship slots for trial, work in hybrid mode.\n\nImplementation Strategy – Stakeholder collaboration with government education departments, college faculty, NGOs, and counselors for content and outreach; technology development partner to build a scalable, lightweight app with offline features; pilot launch in select districts; full-scale rollout through government colleges and skill centers; real-time monitoring and feedback.\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n\n1. Streamlined Internship Process – One-stop solution to find, apply, track, and complete internships.\n\n2. Increased Internship Participation – Easier access and transparency, especially for rural students.\n\n3.
